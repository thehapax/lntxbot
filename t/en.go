	HIDEHELP: `Hides a message so it can be unlocked later with a payment. The special character "~" is used to split the message into a preview and the actual message ("click here to see a secret! ~ this is the secret.")

<code>/hide 2500 'only the rich will be able to see this message' ~ 'congratulations, you are very rich!'</code>: in this case instead of the default preview message potential revealers will see the custom teaser written before the "~".

Anyone can reveal any message (after paying) by typing <code>/reveal &lt;hidden_message_id&gt;</code> in their private chat with the bot, but the id is only known to the message creator unless it shares it.

The basic way to share the message, however, is to click the "share" button and use the inline query in a group or chat. That will post the message preview to the chat along with a button people can click to pay and reveal.  You can control if the message will be revealed in-place for the entire group to see or privately just to the payer using the <code>--public</code> flag. By default it's private.

You can also control how many people will be allowed to reveal it privately using the <code>--revealers</code> argument or how many will be required to pay before it is revealed publicly with the <code>--crowdfund</code> argument.

<code>/hide 100 'three people have paid for this message to be revealed' --crowdfund 3</code>: the message will be revealed publicly once 3 people pay 100 satoshis.
<code>/hide 321 'only 3 people can see this message' ~ "you're one among 3 privileged" --revealers 3</code>: the message will be revealed privately to the first 3 people who click.

	SATS4ADSHELP: `
Sats4ads is an ad marketplace on Telegram. Pay money to show ads to others, receive money for each ad you see.

Rates for each user are in msatoshi-per-character. The maximum rate is 1000 msat.
Each ad also includes a fixed fee of 1 sat.
Images and videos are priced as if they were 300 characters.

To broadcast an ad you must send a message to the bot that will be your ad contents, then reply to it using <code>/sats4ads broadcast ...</code> as described. You can use <code>--max-rate=500</code> and <code>--skip=0</code> to have better control over how your message is going to be broadcasted. These are the defaults.

/sats4ads_on_15 puts your account in ad-listening mode. Anyone will be able to publish messages to you for 15 msatoshi-per-character. You can adjust that price.
/sats4ads_off turns off your account so you won't get any more ads.
/sats4ads_rates shows a breakdown of how many nodes are at each price level. Useful to plan your ad budget early.
/sats4ads_broadcast_1000 broadcasts an ad. The last number is the maximum number of satoshis that will be spend. Cheaper ad-listeners will be preferred over more expensive ones. Must be called in a reply to another message, the contents of which will be used as the ad text.

It also supports <a href="https://github.com/btcontract/lnurl-rfc/blob/master/spec.md#3-lnurl-withdraw">lnurl-withdraws</a> to and from other places, handles pending and failed transactions smoothly, does <a href="https://twitter.com/VNumeris/status/1148403575820709890">QR code scanning</a> (although for that you have to take a picture of the QR code with your Telegram app and that may fail depending on your phone's camera, patience and luck) and other goodies.

Everything you do on <a href="https://bluewallet.io/">BlueWallet</a> afterwards will be reflected in the bot screen and vice-versa (you'll get notifications for payments made and received from <a href="https://bluewallet.io/">BlueWallet</a> on your Telegram, but not the opposite).
